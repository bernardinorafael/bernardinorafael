My goal is to continually evolve as a person and professional!! Always applying best practices in the development of technological solutions, creating scalable and safe uses using Tech design standards. 🚀</strong>

<strong>"There is nothing in this world that is stronger than persistence. Talent is not. Nothing is more common than shiny flaws. Genius won't get over it. Unrecognized genius is actually a cliché. Education does not exceed. The world is full of educated fools. Only persistence and determination are strong." ✨</strong>
